Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

## Machines: VMs can be shutdown and restarted with a single action

Some changes to a virtual machine, such as adding VNC graphics, require it to be completely shut down and restarted before these changes take effect. Cockpit can now do this with a single action.

## Machines: Support for network port forwarding

Cockpit can now configure port forwarding for virtual machines on the user session.
