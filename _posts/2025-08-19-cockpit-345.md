summary: 'IPv6 for Wireguard, detachable VNC console'
---

Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 345 and cockpit-machines 338:


## Networking: Support IPv6 addresses for Wireguard

The Networking page can now configure IPv6 addresses for WireGuard VPN
directly within the WireGuard modal.

## Machines: The VNC console of a virtual machine can be detached

If expanding it is not enough, you can now also detach the VNC console
of a virtual machine. This allows it to use almost all pixels of a
browser window (or tab). The window can then of course be made
fullscreen with browser controls to give (almost) all pixels of a
monitor to the console.
